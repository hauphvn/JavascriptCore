# JavascriptCore
This is a project that I am learning Js with Coder Tokyo.  
I have been studying and solving problems with together.  

Callback
--
This is cool method of Javascript for me.  
Assume that, I want my dog have to sleep after he have eaten.  
I will pass sleep function into eaten function as parameter.  
So that is called Callback.  
To more detail understanding, let's see on Callback.js  

'New' keyword
--
If you create a object by 'new' keyword then you can change its property flexibly,
and code briefly. 
It is also called Construction Function 

Prototypes - Only JS
--
A new object is created by Constructor function will have a prototype.  
Inside that prototype is also a .constructor property.  
Prototype object is shared among all the objects created using 'new'.  
Using prototype to create a method, a property will save memory, because that is created pointer to a memory together.
